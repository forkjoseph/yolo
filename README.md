Use '':set spell'' for spelling check in vim. 
To search for the next misspelled word:

]s           Move to next misspelled word after the cursor.
             A count before the command can be used to repeat.
             'wrapscan' applies.

[s           Like "]s" but search backwards, find the misspelled
             word before the cursor.  
Finding suggestions for bad words:

z=           For the word under/after the cursor, suggest correctly
             spelled words.
To add words to your own word list:

zg           Add word under the cursor as a good word
```
